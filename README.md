# Maze Solver

A web-based app where users can draw a maze, set start/end points, and watch an AI solve the maze using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm.

## Features

- Draw walls to create a maze on a grid.
- Set the start and end points for the AI to navigate.
- Visualize the AI solving the maze using BFS.
- Reset the maze and start again.

## Usage

- Click and drag on the canvas to draw walls.
- Click "Add Start" to place the start point (green).
- Click "Add End" to place the end point (red).
- Click "Search" to let the AI solve the maze.
- Click "Clear" to reset the maze.

## BFS Algorithm

The Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm explores all possible paths in the maze to find the shortest path from the start to the end, highlighting the path once found.
